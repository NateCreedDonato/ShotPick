# ShotPick
A simple game that takes inspiration from the famous battleships games of my childhood. 

Game Description:

The game takes inspiration from the Battleships games of the past and merges it with the popularity of football.

The comprises of 2 players, a "Kicker" and a "Goalie" or "Goalkeeper", a ball and a net (for scoring).

The goal of the game from the Kicker's perspective is to ensure that they score a goal by kicking the ball into the net without the goalkeeper stoping the ball.

The goal of the game from the Goalkeeper's perspective is to ensure that the kicker does not score a goal by blocking the ball.

After each subsequent kick the sides are changed and each player will switch sides.

Winner will be determined as the player with the most goals after 5 attemts, should both players be tied after 5 attempts the game will go into a "sudden death" mode where the player who misses their shot will lose the game.

The game will be created in React Native and will be able to run on both android and IOS
